# Employee-tracker

## Description

The Employee tracker is a back end application that allows the user to view add and update a table of employee's. The obstacle I ran across during this challenege were finding out how to use the data I recieved from the promt questions withing the queries. Also ensuring that the queries that I created actually functioned properly. I utilized inquierer and mysql. I found that the tables that were included within the node were good enough so I did not have to install the console table package.
